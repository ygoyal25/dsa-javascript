**Find K-th Permutation Sequence**

Problem Statement: Given N and K, where N is the sequence of numbers from 1 to N([1,2,3….. N]) find the Kth permutation sequence.

For N = 3  the 3!  Permutation sequences in order would look like this:-

**Note**: 1<=K<=N! Hence for a given input its Kth permutation always exists

```
Examples:

Example 1:

Input: N = 3, K = 3
 
Output: “213”

Explanation: The sequence has 3! permutations as illustrated in the figure above. K = 3 corresponds to the third sequence.

Example 2:

Input: N = 3, K = 5 

Result: “312”

Explanation: The sequence has 3! permutations as illustrated in the figure above. K = 5 corresponds to the fifth sequence.
